Zunzuncito is a simple CMS that generates and deploys static websites.

## Philosophy

The _Zunzuncito_ or _Bee Hummingbird_ is the smallest bird on our planet. _Zunzuncito_ is build to generate super simple and small websites.

The backend should be as simple and clean and possible. Just enough to create a small website.

The frontend we generate should:

* Have clean markup
* clean and small CSS
* have all assets like a
  * favicons
  * robots.txt
  * sitemaps
  * rss-feeds
* Have resized and lazy loaded images
* be completely self-contained and not use any external services like Google-Fonts.

The websites should look like a web developer hand-crafted the resulting site.
